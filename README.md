# henhouse
Python clone of a dice game called Chicken. 

There is no `requirements.txt` file because no files are used outside of the standard python library. You should be able to run this with Python 3.x. 

The purpose of this project is to use the game API to simulate large numbers of rounds to generate data and identify an optimal strategy. 

# Possible extensions
* Use as a basis for training a reinforcement model.
